## What is Glue
* Fully managed ETL service
* Consists of a central metadata catalog repository (glue data catalog)
* Spark ETL Engine
* Flexible Scheduler

# IMAGE glue architecture

## AWS Glue Data Catalog
* Persistent Metadata Store
* Managed service to store, annotate and share metadata wich can be used to query and transdform data
* One glue catalog per AWS Region
* IAM policies control access
* Can be used for data governance
* Store: Data location, checma, data types, data classification...
* Database in Glue
    * Set of associated in Data catalog table definitions organized into logical groups
    * it just organizes the logical data, dont actually move any data 
    * The metadata definition that represnt your data. Data resides in its original store, this is just a representation of the schema

### Create Database Practices
* Organize glue databases in respective folders in S3
* All files for a database should be under the folder, for organization

## AWS Partitions
* Folders where data is stored on S3, which are physical entities, are mapped to parititons, which are logical entities. Ie: columns in glues table
* helps to query data more efficiently because we just query the necessary data

# IMAGE s3 partitions
sample folder structure:
* sales
    * 2019
        * july
        * august
            * 01
            * 02
            * 03

## AWS Glue Crawler
* A program that connects to a data store (source or target), progresses through a prioritized list of classifiers to determine the schema  for your data, and then creates metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog
* Can add data manually in a data catalog (columns by column and its format addition)
* Can add data via crawler also

## AWS Glue Jobs
* Store business logic required for ETL
* It is composed by transformation script, data sources, and data targets
* job runs are initiated by triggers that can be scheduled or triggeres by events
* it is under jobs
    * can select the engine, the temp folder, and the scripts folder

## AWS Triggers
* Create triggers for Glue Jobs
* Triggers can be event based or schedule based

## AWS DEV Endpoint
* Create a cluster to develop scripts and test locally sending the code to test in this cluster on AWS
* Costs can scale very easily
