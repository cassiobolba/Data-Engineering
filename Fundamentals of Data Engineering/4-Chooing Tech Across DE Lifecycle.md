## Chapter 4 - Choosing Technologies Across DE Lifecycle
* How choose tech? Ask if it bring values!
* Dont confunse Architeture to Tool. Archi is strategical, tools are tactical
* Architecture is top level design or blueprint about why, what and when you do with data
* tools are the how in an architecture

Considerations on choosing technologies:

* Team size and capabilities
* Speed to market
* Interoperability
* Cost optimization and business value
* Today versus the future: immutable versus transitory technologies
* Location (cloud, on prem, hybrid cloud, multicloud)
* Build versus buy
* Monolith versus modular
* Serverless versus servers
* Optimization, performance and the benchmark wars.
* The undercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle

### 4.1 - Team Size and Capabilitiies
* Evaluate you team size and tech capabilites
* small teams usually wear all hats, big temas can be more specialised
* Small teams need to evaluate easy tools, mostly SaaS, to speed

### 4.2 - Speed to Market
* Think fast on tech that can enable bring value fast
* deliver value early and often

### 4.3 - Interoperability
* When choosing components, check if they can operate easily with each other
* check of they operate with the legacy systems
* Consider also design for modularity

### 4.4 - Cost Optimization and Business Value
* Cost must be managed for you to know the ROI of your data team / architecture
* 3 main lenses:

#### 4.4.1 - Total Cost of Ownership
* Salaries
* AWS bill
* Can be Capex (paied before use) or Opex (pay durgin and after use, like pays as you go)
* It is suggested to DE take the opex-first approach, and closely check ccosts on cloud

#### 4.4.2 - Total Opportunity cost of Ownership
* TOCO, is the cost of lost opportunitiy when we choose a tech or arch over other
* What is the cost to move to other tech you initially did not choose because the initial one is obsolete or poor now?

#### 4.4.3 - FinOps
* The goal of FinOps is to fully operationalize financial accountability and business value by applying the DevOps-like practices of monitoring and dynamically adjusting systems
* It saves money
* but also enable you to evaluate need of resoures, map new products, test approaches seeking efficiency

### 4.5 - Today vs Future: Immutable vs Transitory Technologies
* Choose tech to solve present problems and near future ones
* Consider Immutable tools: 
    * OBJECT storage
    * network
    * security measures
    * SQL
    * bash
    * Relational DB
    * C
    * 86x arch
* Evaluate Transitory tech carefully:
    * New techs promissing to change the world
    * Example in DE world: Hive
    * Solved the problem of writting map reduce jobs, but was later replaced for even more friendly tech

#### 4.5.1 Book writters Advice
* Evaluate tools every 2 years, to dont get crazy with much tools that appear daily
* Try always to go for immutable tools
* Build the non immutable tools around the immutable in a way they can be replaced

### 4.6 - Location
* Usually hosted on premisses or in the cloud

#### 4.6.1 - On Premisses
