## Chapter 3 - Designing Good Data Architecture
### 3.1 What is Data Architecture?
Hard to define as much as is to define DE.   
Lets first understand what is a Enterprise Architecture (Data Arch. fits inside)

#### 3.1.1 Enterprise Architecture
Comprise:
* Business Arch
* Tech Arch
* Application Arch
* Data Arch

“Enterprise architecture is the design of systems to support change in the enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through careful evaluation of trade-offs.”
*Excerpt From: Joe Reis. “Fundamentals of Data Engineering”. Apple Books.*

#### 3.1.2 Data Architecture
“Data architecture is the design of systems to support the evolving data needs of an enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through a careful evaluation of trade-offs.”
*Excerpt From: Joe Reis. “Fundamentals of Data Engineering”. Apple Books.* 
Data Achitecture can be divided in 2:
* Operational: What?
    * what are the purposses to use data ?
    * What are the data management constaints?
    * What is the latency requirement?
* Technical: How?
    * How we will move 10tb per h ?

#### 3.1.3 GOOD Data Achitecture
Data architects aim to make significant decisions that will lead to good architecture at a basic level. A good Data Arch comprises:
* Agility
* Flexibility
* Maintainability
* Think of reversability
* Apply the Datalifecycle undercurrents
* Its is living and changing thing and is never finished

### 3.2 Principles of Good Data Architecture
Based on the AWS well-achitected framework and on Google Cloud principles for Cloud Native Architecture, the book brings 9 key points: Choose common components wisely, Plan for failure, Architect for scalability, Architecture is leadership, Always be architecting, Build loosely coupled systems, Make reversible decisions, Prioritize security, Embrace FinOps.
