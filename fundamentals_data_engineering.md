# FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA ENGINEERING
*THESE ARE NOTES FROM THE BOOK, FOR FURTHER CHECKS.*   
"we unapologetically take a cloud-first approach. We view the cloud as a fundamentally transformative development that will endure for decades; most on-premises data systems and workloads will eventually move to cloud hosting. We assume that infrastructure and systems are ephemeral and scalable, and that data engineers will lean toward deploying managed services in the cloud".  

## CHAPTER 1 - Foundation and Building Blocks
### Definition of DE
“Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.”

### A bit of history 
*(in my words, a summary).*   
* In earlies 70 the web systems needed sources to store the bom o web based application, then databases raised faster
* Around 80's wiht the need to analyze it, Kimbal invented the famous DW concept (widely used today). This also brought up the term BI Engineer, ETL developer and so on
* 90's brought the big data term due to internet + web applications generating massive amount of data, opnening space for companies like google, yahoo and amazon to emerge on it
* 90's boom is also a stater for yahoo engineers create the Apache Hadooop and map reduce system
* In the next years, Big Data Engineers were basically too focused on mainiting these infrastucture, which were very technically hard to do, and expensive
* Now a days mostly of the complexity of these distributed system are abstracted under the hood by cloud providers and reshaping the term Big Data Engineers, to Data Engineers
* A nice new concept: Data Lifecyle Engineers is brought by this book, which I really feel like what I do now!
