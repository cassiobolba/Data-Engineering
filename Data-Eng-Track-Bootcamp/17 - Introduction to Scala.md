# INTRODUCTION TO SCALA
**What is Scala**
* General Purpose programing language
* For Functional programing offering STRONG static tyep system
* Based on Java 
* Code is intedented to be compiled in Java Bytecode and run on JVM  
**Flexibility**
* Let you add new types, collections and control structs, like they are native to the language  
**Convinient**
* But, it also has a set of convinient types, collections and control struct

## SCALA CODE AND SCALA INTERPRETER
* Scala combines Object-Oriented and Functional Programing
    * Contributes to scalability
* it is OO:
    * Every value is an object
    * Every operation is a method
* It is functional:
    * Functions are first-class values
    * Programs operations should map an input to an output, rather than changing data in place
* Scala Static Types help avoid bugs
* JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems
* Easy access to many libraries

### The interpreter
* Use the '$ scala' to initialize the interpreter (after instalation)

* When you type 2 + 3, it packs, translate to a method and returns an auto-generated result called res0:
* you can use the output in another operation, like res0 * 2
